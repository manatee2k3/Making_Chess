# Making_Chess


Having a go at making working chess.

im sure theres hundreds if not thousands of repositarys with chess,but im going to try my best to make a working chess game without cheating and searching someone elses code. 

Chess V1: my first stream of conciousness, dosent include comments and will work on adding those and figuring out the game itself, currently i have a visual chess board. and yes Im aware I named the pawns prawns, I like seafood! 


Chess V2: Now includes basic comments and a working chess board. there are no chess rules so you could move any piece wherever you want, but it can swap from player to player and can choose a chess piece based on its location and move it to a new location.
